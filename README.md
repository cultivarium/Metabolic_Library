# Metabolic_Library
A collection of metabolic annotations and networks for our organism collection.

## Annotation collection
Initial annotations will be collected from KEGG (Enzymes, Reactions, Compounds, Pathways)

Optional (Licensing dependant) - BioCyc (contains inferred annotations that might introduce biases/noise)
